# 411_ARM_PROJECT


Resources

1. Interesting reading on trig functions. may be code can be used to understand trig calculation algorithms in some way. 
code ex on page 61: http://nnp.ucsd.edu/phy120b/application_notes/an660_floating_point.pdf

2. this has explanation of the cordic algorithm for cos(x) on page 2 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.58.396&rep=rep1&type=pdf

 
3. cordic algorithm explanation and implementation: has an implementation diagram on page 23 http://web.cs.ucla.edu/digital_arithmetic/files/ch11.pdf

4. this explains cordic algorithm theory and gives implementation pseudocode on page 25 http://www.msc.uky.edu/droyster/courses/fall06/PDFs/Chapter08.pdf (edited)


5. contains some ARM and C code
